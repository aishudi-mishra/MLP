# MLPLib
This library is an attempt to implement all the neural network layers from scratch and get an understanding about internal flow of a neural network.

The Library code is available in src directory, which contains: Activations, Layers, Loss Functions and Optimizer. Neuron is created for internal use by Layers. List of implemented functionalities are as follows:-
### Activations 
#### Relu
#### Sigmoid
#### Tanh

### Layers
#### Dense

### Loss
#### Cross Entropy Loss

### Optimizer
#### Gradient Descent

The code also contains a testbench that currently has a unit neural network test. This network contains one neuron and trains the network on 3 data points with 3 input values each. Steps to run this testbench:-
#### python main.py

It is suggested to run this testbench after activating the virtual environment __venv__.
